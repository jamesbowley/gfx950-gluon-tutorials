FMHA v4: a CDNA4 (gfx950) flash multi-head attention forward kernel with LAZY
softmax rescaling.

This is fmha_v3.py with one algorithmic change: the online-softmax accumulator
correction (``acc *= alpha``) is applied *lazily*. Softmax is shift-invariant --
subtracting the running max only exists to keep the exp2 argument bounded -- so
the running max is allowed to LAG: it is only bumped (and the accumulator
rescaled) when a tile's max exceeds the running max by more than
``LAZY_RESCALE_THRESHOLD`` (in log2 units; 8 -> a 2**8 = 256x safety margin,
trivially within fp32's dynamic range). When the max is stable the correction is
skipped, so p = exp2(score - m_lag) can rise up to ~256 but the final acc / l_i
(both carried in the same lagging frame) is unchanged. Same idea as ROCm/FlyDSL
`dualwave_swp_lazy_rescale` and Flash-Attention-4's deferred/threshold correction.

Two separate decisions implement that, and they are worth keeping apart. The *max
update* is gated branchlessly with a per-row ``gl.where``, so control flow stays
uniform. The *correction itself* is a real branch: ``rescale_lazy`` runs it through
``gl.map_elementwise`` with a scalar body that tests ``alpha != 1`` once per thread;
the backend lowers that to ``s_and_saveexec`` + ``s_cbranch_execz``, which skips the
block entirely for any wavefront none of whose rows advanced. The branch
is the point -- a row carrying alpha == 1 is numerically a no-op, but its multiply
still issues and still costs its four cycles, so eliding that VALU needs control
flow rather than a multiply by one.

It contains the Gluon kernel, its single autotune config, and the host launcher
(``run_gluon_attention``); correctness and benchmarking live in ``bench.py``. This
tutorial copy is simplified to the single most-performant path: non-causal, head
dim 128, K length a multiple of ``BLOCK_N`` (64).

The design behind this file -- why the softmax has to ride in the MFMA clusters,
how the loop is cut into four warp-pipeline clusters, and what the compiler has to
be told so the vector work lands inside an MFMA's shadow -- is written up in
``README.md`` in this directory.

Build environment: both kernels want the llirSched plugin loaded and MachineSink
disabled (see the README). The two settings the README's numbers use are already
the defaults -- the plugin paces the mem stages with ``LLIRSCHED_WP_MEMNOP=2``,
and ``SCALE_ON_Q`` below defaults to True -- so a plain run is the tuned one.
Neither kernel wants ``AMDGCN_SCALARIZE_PACKED_FOPS``: both start from packed
math and the plugin declares its groups in instructions, so the backend peephole
splits whatever lands in a shadow.

# K/V instead of staging it through VGPRs, which removes the blanket `s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)`
# the register path forces.
#
# It does what it says: prologue 16429 -> 13313 cycles per workgroup, 8 `global_load` and 8
# `ds_write` gone, VGPRs 256 -> 246, and both paths validate bit-identically. It is not the
# default because the *loop* regresses 2.9% (in-loop MFMA efficiency 94.5% -> 91.8%) for two
# reasons that live outside this kernel:
#
#   - deferring the `q_dot` read past the K/V allocation extends `q_smem`'s live range, so
#     Triton can no longer overlay it with `kt_smem`/`v_smem`; LDS goes 68016 -> 134560 B and
#     the K/V offsets stop fitting a `ds_read`'s 16-bit `offset:` field;
#   - the lower register pressure makes the allocator reassign across the whole function, and
#     the llirSched interleave lands differently on the result.
#
# Picking it up means addressing one of those, not this code. With the switch off, the
# generated prologue, loop and epilogue are byte-identical to the build before this existed.
